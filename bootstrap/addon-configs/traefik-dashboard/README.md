Splendid deduction! 🕵️‍♂️ You’ve reached the Traefik dashboard **the right way**—by letting `k3d` expose port `9000` from the outset, skipping all the common pitfalls. Now, let us document your success properly with a clean, explanatory `README.md` for the `traefik/` folder in your Helix repo.

Below is a ready-to-drop-in `README.md` that documents how you got here, what the dashboard shows, what ports do what, and what you might do next (metrics, security, and ingress hardening).

# 🚦 Traefik Dashboard Setup in Helix Cluster

Welcome to the Traefik edge router dashboard, configured as part of the Helix bootstrap sequence. This document explains how we reached a working state, what each exposed port does, and what you can explore next.

---

## ✅ Dashboard Access

The Traefik dashboard is accessible **immediately after cluster creation** at:

```

[http://localhost:9000/dashboard/](http://localhost:9000/dashboard/)

````

No `kubectl port-forward` required — port `9000` was pre-bound by the Docker-based `k3d` load balancer.

## ⚙️ Traefik Ports Mapped by k3d

| Name         | Container Port | Host Port | Purpose                          |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| `traefik`    | 9000           | 9000      | Dashboard and internal API       |
| `web`        | 8000           | 80        | HTTP routing                     |
| `websecure`  | 8443           | 443       | HTTPS routing                    |
| `metrics`    | 9100           | N/A       | Prometheus scrape endpoint       |

Configured via:

```bash
k3d cluster create helix \
  --port 80:80@loadbalancer \
  --port 443:443@loadbalancer \
  --port 9000:9000@loadbalancer

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

### ✅ HTTP Routers

* 100% success, 6 routers active.
* No warnings or errors.
* Routes include Keycloak, Vault, and other internal services.

### ✅ Services

* 6 backend services registered successfully.

### ✅ Middlewares

* 2 middlewares active (likely stripPrefix, auth, etc).

### 🚫 TCP / UDP Routers

* Not yet in use — available for future integrations (e.g. TLS passthrough, PostgreSQL proxying).

## 🔐 Security Note

This setup uses the `--api.insecure=true` flag to expose the dashboard without authentication. **This is fine for local testing**, but **must be secured** in production environments.

### 📌 To secure the dashboard:

* Create an IngressRoute with:

  * Basic Auth middleware
  * IP whitelisting
  * TLS via cert-manager

---

## 📈 Next Steps

* [ ] **Secure the dashboard** using IngressRoute + Auth middleware
* [ ] **Integrate with Prometheus**

  * Enable Prometheus scraping of `:9100`
  * Visualize metrics in Grafana
* [ ] **Enable access logging** for observability
* [ ] **Define middlewares** for common patterns (CORS, redirect, auth)
* [ ] **Write IngressRoutes** for `Keycloak`, `Vault`, etc.

## 🧠 TL;DR

You're running a **modern, production-aligned Traefik edge router**, with:

* Dashboard via `localhost:9000`
* TLS-ready routing via `cert-manager`
* Observability ready via Prometheus metrics

Keep calm and route on. 🧭

Would you like me to also generate:
- The secure `IngressRoute` YAML for the dashboard?
- Helm `values.yaml` tuned for Helix use (TLS, Prometheus, no insecure API)?

Just say the word.
