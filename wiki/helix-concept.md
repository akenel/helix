🧠 Helix Pitch Deck for Developers

🟣 Slide 1: Title Slide
Helix: The Developer’s Launchpad  
Enterprise-grade infrastructure. Open-source freedom. Built for builders.

---

🔥 Slide 2: The Problem
Cloud Lock-In. Complexity. Cost.  
- Developers are told they need cloud subscriptions to build anything serious  
- They’re stuck with abstracted platforms, hidden fees, and limited control  
- Most tools are demos — not deployable, scalable, or secure

---

💡 Slide 3: The Awakening
You Already Have the Power  
- Your laptop is more powerful than most cloud VMs  
- Kubernetes is the key — but it’s hard to configure  
- Developers need a real-world stack that works locally and scales globally

---

🚀 Slide 4: What Is Helix?
Helix is a modular, developer-first infrastructure platform  
- Built on Kubernetes, Docker, Helm  
- Includes Keycloak, Vault, Traefik, Postgres  
- Plug-and-play architecture for real-world apps  
- Runs locally, on VPS, or in the cloud — your choice

🧩 Slide 5: What You Can Build
Helix is not a demo. It’s a launchpad.  
- LMS platforms (Moodle)  
- E-commerce (Medusa)  
- Automation (n8n)  
- Game servers (Minecraft, Garry’s Mod)  
- SaaS products  
- Custom dashboards, APIs, and more

💰 Slide 6: Monetization Paths
Turn your Helix into a business  
- Sell courses via your own LMS  
- Host game servers for communities  
- Launch SaaS products with full stack control  
- Offer consulting, hosting, or plug-in development  
- Build your own marketplace
